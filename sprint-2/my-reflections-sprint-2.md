# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

To help demonstrate and practice some of the concepts touched on in the introductory video, we started setting up a blog in our GitHub pages repository (**craig-mclean.github.io**). This involved creating an `.html` and a `.css` file.

First we created a new folder called 'blog' inside of the github.io directory.  This is where the new .html file lives.
The .html file was created using the `touch` command and then the content was pasted in from link.
After doing the add/committ/push we confirmed that the new file and folder had loaded and were working, by viewing the .html from within the github.io folder.

Next, we moved on to the CSS.  Again, the first step was to create a folder to contain the main.css file.  This folder was at the same level as the blog folder. We used the touch command to create `main.css` inside of the CSS folder.

Finally, we had to make sure that the HTML file knew about the CSS file, so we open the HTML file and replaced the placeholder link (e.g. the href element) with the pathway to the `main.css` file that we just created.

We were able to check how everything looked by opening the local copy within Chrome.
The command for this from windows was `wslview filename.html` (the `open` command doesn't work for me).

Then we pushed our work up to GitHub and checked that we had the correct folder structure, and had the files in the right places. 

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

This exercise was relatively straight forward, so I was OK time-wise. 

However, when I came to the **Reflect** part of the exercise, I found that I must have stuffed up something in Sprint 1, as I just could not find my local copy of the reflections folder. This threw me and I was a little unsure how to rectify the problem.  I reached out on Discord and got some advice from a classmate and from Joseph and got it sorted (I think!), but it took way too long.

I cloned all the reflections files down to another directory, and then I'll copy them across from there to my **craig-mclean.github.io** folder as and when I need to reflect on each sprint. Then when my reflection responses are ready, I'll add/commit/push them from there back up to github so that they can viewed and assessed.  Hope that makes sense.
