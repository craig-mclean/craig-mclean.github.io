# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

We created the location for our blog.
This involved setting up a specfic folder structure and adding some specific files, at least one that contains the HTML and one that contains the styling rules (CSS). We then pointed the HTML file to the CSS

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

They are a good guide, but I am finding I'm spending longer than recommended, as there are so many rabbit holes to go down!


# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

FreeCodeCamp was ok, but it was a bit frustrating not to be able to skip ahead of some of the more 'niche' exercises, to get to the more important material.
I found that Udacity was quite buggy.

I found the best way was to use Google and YouTube.  There is so much out there to learn from, so I found one or two presenters who seemed to explain things well and had good examples, so I watched a lot of their content.   
Rather than doing one-off, stand-alone questions from FreeCodeCamp, I prefered to follow along with these YouTube presenter, as the content seemed more practical and the concepts linked together better.  

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

I am proud that I managed to learn so much in such a short period of time. Pretty much going from zero to having enough skill to create and style a webpage.
However, I know enough now to know that there is so much I don't know - which is a little daunting!
Having said that though, there are so many resources online that it seems you can find answers to what you need most of the time.

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

HTML and CSS is a little like that TV show, 10 Years Younger in 10 Days, where they take someone and give them a complete makeover.
The person starts off as being HTML.  They have all the usual human forms - head, body, arms, legs, etc - but they look quite basic.
The people who give them fashion advice about what to wear and when, and do some basic cosmetic and dental surgery, are like the CSS. They take something that is already there and is functioning (e.g. a person) and apply style to change their appearance and help it to (arguably) look 'better' and be easier to use. 
### Any moments of surprise or joy? 

It is really satifying to wrap similar pieces of html in a <div> and then see how easily you can change it across your whole site by using CSS.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

I quite like my analogy above, where HTML is a 'plain' looking person and CSS is the fashion consultant/stylist.
