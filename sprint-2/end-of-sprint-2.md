# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

I am confident that I understand the purpose of the blog, and how to set up the structure and link the HTML/CSS files.
I have a very basic understanding of the 'Learn HTML & CSS' competencies, but some of my knowledge seems quite thin at this stage. I have looked into the box design concept, but haven't played with it too much, I understand the concept of responsive design and tried incorporate it into my blog, but it still looks terrible on a mobile!  I made it so that it would change the text colour when you resize it, so at least that works, even if the overall layout looks bad! 
I am OK with setting up a basic HTML page and using appropriate tags and the importance of POSH (Plain Old Scemantic HTML). I can use CSS to control some things, but not in a very sophisticated way yet and I can't get everything to behave the way I want it to. There is heaps that I would look to fix on my blog, but there's only so much time!


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

I'd say it would be the 'nuts and bolts' of getting the structure right (folders, pages linking together, etc)

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

I'm not very confident yet with CSS and making things look the way they do in my head!


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

I think I would be harder on myself if it wasn't for Joseph's advice in our Wednesday meeting, where he said we really just need to understand the basics, and then have any appreciation for what sort of things are possible - no need to try to master things yet, or try to memorise things.
I have been exposed to a LOT of concepts this week so I feel OK about knowing what is possible and knowing that while I may not know how to do it, I can probably find the resources I need to help me with it as/when needed (aka just in time learning!)


### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

I'd say that making a website is pretty easy. You don't need fancy tools and you can create something quite quickly.
Making it look good is quite a different story though!
That's where things can be very complicated and it gets frustrating! But if you build it right, you have a much better chance of being able to make it look good.
