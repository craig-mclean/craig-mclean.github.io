# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Most of the problems I faced were due to me not being careful enough when following instructions! I have managed to miss crucial steps more often than I'd have liked! This has resulted in quite a lot of frustration and wasted time.
I've been using Discord when I've hit brick walls and am grateful for the help that I've received from fellow students!

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Despite facing a few problems along the way and having to redo some steps and seek some help, I am reasonably comfortable with things so far.

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

I've enjoyed starting my learning journey at last, but I wouldn't say that learning about git and github has been super exciting!

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

As above, git and github has been a bit tedious, but I'm confident that it will become second nature eventually.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

No - I just got frustrated with myself at times. I just need to not rush things to much.
