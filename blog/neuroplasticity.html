            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>Sprint 4 introduced us to the concept of <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>.</p>
            <p>I have explored this fascinating topic and provided some answers to the following questions:</p>

            <ul>                 
              <li><a href="#principles">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</a></li>
              <li><a href="#increase">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</a></li>
              <li><a href="#how">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>I discuss each of these in more detail below.</p>

              <h3 id="principles">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
                <p>Neuroplasticity describes the way the brain can change and adapt, as a result of experience.
                  There are many benefits to neuroplasticity. If you allow your brain to adapt and change, this can help promote:</p>
                  <ul>                 
                    <li>The ability to learn new things.</li>
                    <li>The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities</li>
                    <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
                    <li>Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined</li>
                    <li>Improvements that can boost brain fitness </li>
                  </ul>

              <h3 id="increase">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
                <p>There is a saying "cells that fire together, wire together", suggesting that if repeatedly practice something, the groups of neurons involved in allowing you to do that activity actually shape themselves together and create a stronger pathway, which in turn makes it easier to do the activity.</p>
                <p>As well as regular activity, the following steps can help facilitate change within your brain, at any age:</p>
                  
                  <h4>Enrich your environment</h4>
                    <p>Do this by allowing lots of opportunities for focused attention, novelty and challenge. The following types of activities can help:</p>
                      <ul>                 
                        <li>Learning a new language</li>
                        <li>Playing an instrument</li>
                        <li>Creative pursuits, such as making art</li>
                        <li>Reading</li>
                      </ul>

                  <h4>Improve your sleep</h4>
                    <p>Sleep has been shown to play an important role in 'dendritic growth' within the brain. Dendrites help neurons transmit information from one neuron to the next. If you can strengthen these connections, this helps encourage an increase in brain plasticity.</p>

                  <h4>Exercise regularly</h4>
                    <p>Research suggests that regular physical activity can help prevent neurons in the part of the brain that controls memory (the hippocampus) and can stimulate the formation of new neurons.</p>
                
              <h3 id="how">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
                <p>I can already see that DevAcademy is following the principles of neuroplasticity.  Firstly, by exposing us to the theory of it (as it has been shown that students can do better when they understand that their intelligence is malleable) and secondly, by introducing us to regular practice (such as Sprint 4's 'kata').</p>
                <p>Sometimes I feel like my brain has become less sharp than it used to be when I was younger and I wonder if that is because I haven't been providing it with enough on an enriched environment - e.g. getting stuck in a rut, work-wise and not really learning many new things - this may have reduced some of opportunities for creating new neural pathways in recent years.</p>
                <p>I'm looking forward to seeing how my ability to learn new things improves during my DevAcademy journey, due to the combination of the very regular practice we are going to have (!) and greater awareness of what neuroplasticity is and how it can be improved. </p>
                  <h4>Link to a resource:</h4>
                    <p>In researching this topic, I found this <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer" alt="Link to article">this</a> article, which explained things pretty well.</p>
  
            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p>We were also introduced to the concept of a <strong>Growth Mindset</strong> and were asked to research it and contemplate a number of questions.</p>
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
              <p>Individuals with a 'growth mindset' are more inclined to believe that, through hard work, good planning and with input from others, they can develop their own talents.  The converse of this is a 'fixed mindset', where people believe that their abilities, talents, or traits are fixed. You are born with them and can't change them.</p>
              <p>This is very relevant for me at DevAcademy, because a fixed mindset will inhibit my ability to pick up the many new concepts that I am being exposed to and I will close myself off to the possibilities of learning from others.  Adopting growth mindset would seem to me to be a prerequisite for improving neuroplasticity. </p>
              <p>Effort and difficulty: instead of this making you seem "stupid", if you adopt a growth mindset and allow yourself to put in more effort and embrace the difficulty, then this is when you will start making more and stronger neural connections and you will learn more.</p>        
  
            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
              <p>As a parent, I found this really interesting and it has made me reflect on the way I have praised my children.
                 The idea of praising them for the process that they are following, rather than for the result that they achieved struck a chord with me.</p>
              <p>My oldest son is very intelligent and got very good grades at school, but really only with constant badgering from his parents! 
                 Now that he is at uni, we have realised just how bad his planning skills are and can see how much he struggles with the process side of things. Trying to get started on things can be overwhelming for him, so he gives up. I think this struggle is really bringing him down and he doesn't feel like he belongs at uni. </p>
              <p>My wife and I have realised that we really need to help him with this, so I think the concept of shifting our focus away from how he is achieving, towards the process that he is using and his resilience and perseverance - and giving construction feedback and praise in relation to that, will be a useful technique.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't say that he has a fixed mindset, but maybe the way we have praised his results in the past has meant that he is inclined to withdraw from something that seems to difficult - where he doesn't know where to start. </p>

            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
              <p>I will adopt the mindset of "not yet", rather than "not achieved". This is a simple word substitution, but it sends a powerful message that, while I may not have got the right answer yet, I will eventually.</p>
              <p>I will also give due recognition to the process and strategies that I am using to solve problems and when I make mistakes, I'll look for opportunities to learn from them.</p>
              <p>I will remember that I'm not in competition with my fellow students and will aim to take inspiration from their successes. Instead, as cheesy as this may sound, the only competition is between the person I am now (the 'new' me) and the person I was yesterday (the 'old' me).  </p>

            <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
            <p><a href="https://factorialhr.com/blog/growth-mindset-meaning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer" alt="Link to article">This</a> article summarises Dr Dweck's findings really well and puts them into the context of what a workplace or organisation can do to help shift its culture towards one that embraces the growth mindset, including a discussion of how Microsoft did this. </p>

            <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
            <p>Finally, we were asked to reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence our learning plan and strategy.</p>
            
          <p>My learning plan asks the question "What will I do when things are building up and starting to get to me?".
            Based on what I have learned today about neuroplasticity and growth mindsets, another thing that I would do to try and cope is to really look at the process that I'm using. Recognise, and keep doing, what is working, but where it's not worknig so well, look to change it up. Don't just focus on the fact that something is not working, but look for ways to learn from it and remember that is just not working <strong>yet</strong></p>
