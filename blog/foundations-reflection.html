            <h3>Three new things I have learnt about myself during Core:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>You can teach an old dog new tricks!</li>
                    <p>
                      When I compare my level of knowledge 5 weeks ago with now, it is amazing how much I have learnt aleady!
                <li>Reflecting on the learning seems to work</li>
                  <p>
                    Taking the time to stop learning, and instead, reflect on the learning, really does seem to help make things 'stick'.
                  </p>
                <li>Reflecting on the process of learning also helps!</li>
                  <p>
                    As Carol Dweck told us during the core topics on neuroplasticity and growth mindsets, you can improve on your ability to learn. 
                    And you can actually start doing this by simply being aware that you can do it and focusing on the process of learning, 
                    rather than just the learning outcomes            
                  </p>
              </ol>
            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Values</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    I think by having an awareness of my values, this will help me recognise and identify the type of environment that I will be happiest and most productive/motivated in. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    E.g. When looking for a programming role, it will be important to consider the values of the company and the people that I have 
                    met from the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If it feels 'wrong', it probably is.
                  </p>
              <li><strong>Empathy and Self-Awareness</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I have grouped empathy and self-awareness together as they are both key components of emotional intelligence - or EQ - which is all about your ability to sense
                  emotion in yourself and in other people, and also how you use that awareness to guide your behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By being more empathetic towards others, you will be more aware of what they are feeling and experiencing.  If you can combine this with 
                  having a heightened awareness of your own feelings and emotions (which you can improve on by practicing mindfulness), you will be well equipped 
                  to use this information to guide your own thinking and actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In short, your EQ will be improved and it has been shown that this can greatly improve your success in the workplace.
                </p>
        </ul>

            <h3>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                Some of the topics we had to explore were quite interesting and thought provoking. I thought core would be a lot of common sense and stuff 
                I already knew about. I feel like Iâ€™m already good with people and reading people, etc, but a lot of core so far seems to be based on recognizing 
                how I can not only grow and learn, but also train myself to get better at growing and learning.    
              </p>
              <p>
                The concept of having a 'growth mindset' and being able to improve your learning outcomes, in part through simply adopting a different mindset, 
                has been quite powerful.
                When working on exercises, I am trying to place less importance on whether I got something right, and more on the process that I followed and 
                when things have gone worng (as they often seem to!), then treat this as a great learning experience. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I like the idea of "not yet", rather than "not achieved".
              </p>


            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                One of the harder aspects about core is that, within the limitations of this being fully on-line learning, there haven't been a lot of 
                opportunities to directly interact with others in real-time.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also feel that there has been soooo much new tech-stuff to learn, that this has put a squeeze on the amount of time that I have 
                able to commit to my core learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                This probably reflects the 'real world' though, in that 'getting the job done' is often seen is being the most important thing, with the 
                really important 'core' topics being side-lined - which can lead directly to some pretty poor outcomes, in terms of behaviours and culture. 
              </p>
            
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
              <p>
                Programming is all about working with other people (clients, colleagues, etc) to solve problems. If we ignore the 'core' concepts,
                we are more at risk of failure on many fronts, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Not getting the requirements right, due to not listening properly to the client (conscious listening). </li>
                  <li>Damaging our relationships with colleagues, by displaying a lack of empathy when giving feedback</li>
                  <li>Not responding well to feedback ourselves, due to (for example) having a 'closed mindset'.</li>
                  <li>Not learning from our mistakes - again, as a result of having a closed rather than a growth mindset.</li>
                  <li>Becoming overly stressed, or unwell, due to not listening to ourselves and practicing mindfulness.</li>
                </ul>  
              </p>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
              <p>
                No, not a waste of time at all. I'd say there are a least three reasons for this:
              </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>For all the reasons listed above, success with any job, including coding, is reliant on having strong EQ, not just being strong technically.</li>
                  <li>Also, as discussed, by putting some focus on the process of learning, we can improve our learning outcomes.</li>
                  <li>Finally, if we were to spend all of our time learning and practicing coding, I'd probably go a little bit crazy! </li>
                </ol>
              <p>
