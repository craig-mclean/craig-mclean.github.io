            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>One definition (from Saolvey and Mayer 1990, as per our notes) is that it is: <strong>the ability to monitor one's own and others feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them
              and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions</strong>.</p>
            <p>There are three steps to Emotional Intelligence:</p>

            <ol>                 
              <li>The practice of mindfulness</li>
              <li>Self-knowledge and mastery</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>E.g. of who we are, how we are and how we engage in any particular situation</li>
                  <li>From this comes mastery ... you know what happens when you get in certain situations and how to regulate it</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Creating useful mental habits</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Use as defences against negative, critical thoughts that you might have.</li>
                <li>Train our minds to develop habits to defend against the 'superego' (the critical, judging mind).</li>
              </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
              <p>IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability, including how well you can:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use logic</li>
                  <li>Solve problems</li>
                  <li>Plan, strategise</li>
                  <li>Understand abstract ideas</li>
                  <li>Learn and adapt to change</li>
                  <li>Grasp and use language</li>
                </ul>
              <p>EQ is more to do with your ability to sense emotion in yourself and in other people, and also how you use that awareness to guide your behaviour.</p>
              <p>If you have high EQ, you may find it easier to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify emotions in yourself and others</li>
                  <li>Empathise with others</li>
                  <li>Adapt your feelings and behaviours to different situations</li>
                  <li>Control your impulses</li>
                  <li>Withstand temptations</li>
                  <li>Resolve conflicts with others</li>
                  <li>Communicate effectively.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>Three primary benefits to developing EQ are:</p>
            <ol>                 
              <li>Stellar performance</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>According to Daniel Goldman (one of the founders of Emotional Intelligence), studies have shown EQ is twice as important as IQ in a work environment.  It becomes even more important the higher up the ladder you go.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Outstanding leadership</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Once you get to higher levels, EQ skills account for close to 90% of what distinguishes outstanding leaders from average ones (Kemper 1999).</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Happiness</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Strive for an "optimal state of being", not just a pleasurable feeling or a fleeting mood or emotion.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <p>Emotional intelligence has been linked to job success and more satisfying relationships. There's also evidence that emotional intelligence may help you handle stress. A 2019 research review concluded that emotional intelligence can help you recover more quickly from acute stress.</p>
