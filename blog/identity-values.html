        <h2>Values, Strengths and Culture</h2>
          <p>In Sprint 1, we were asked to do some exploration about our 
            <a href="#values">personal values</a>, our 
            <a href="#strengths">strengths</a> and our 
            <a href="#culture">culture.</a></p>
          <p>We were encouraged to try out some online resources to help with this.</p>
          
          <h3>Personal values</h3>
          <p>I visited <a href="https://personalvalu.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer" alt="Link to personalvalu.es">personalvalu.es</a> and worked through a set of questions that they had.</p>
          <p>This is what it came up with for me:</p>

          <div>
            <h4 id="values">My values:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Family: </strong> Caring for loved ones </li>
              <li><strong>Authenticity: </strong> Truthfulness, genuineness </li>
              <li><strong>Health: </strong> Wellbeing, fitness, not being sick</li>
              <li><strong>Ethics: </strong> Moral behaviour</li>
              <li><strong>Pleasure: </strong> Enjoyment, happiness, satisfaction</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h4>Ethical example</h4>
          <p>We were asked to explore or ethics a little further and answer the following question:</p>
          <p><em>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</em></p>
          <p>I was in between jobs once and had an offer to work for a company. The pay would have been really good, but I had doubts about the trustworthiness of the person I met and the ethics and culture of the organisation.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, I needed work, but on the other hand I felt the need to be true to myself and my values.  I chose not to work for them and found other work that was a much better fit for me.
          </p>

          <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <p>After looking into our values, the next task was to reflect on our strengths.</p>
          <p>Once again, I used an online tool, <a href="https://high5test.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener no referrer" alt="Link to high5test.com">high5test.com,</a> to see how it fitted with my own assessment.</p>
          <p>The tool summarised my strengths as follows:</p>
          <div>
            <h4 id="strengths">My Strengths:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Empathiser</li>
              <li>Deliverer</li>
              <li>Problem Solver</li>
              <li>Peace keeper</li>
              <li>Coach</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
   

          <h3>Culture</h3>
          <p>Finally, we were asked to reflect on how our culture has influenced our values and identity.</p>          
          <h4 id="culture">My response:</h4>
          <p>As a NZ pakeha, for some reason I haven’t really considered that I have a culture – e.g. in the way that a maori, pacific islander, or someone from another part of the world has (at least to me) a much more visible culture of their own – so I’ve never given much thought to my own culture.</p>
          <p>However, if I was to think about what a “culture” is, it is things like the norms, behaviours, expectations, institutions, beliefs etc, that I have grown up with and been influenced by, from my family and peers.</p>
          <p>For me, this has made me value things like providing my family with the stability that I grew up with, placing great value in the power of education and learning to help create better opportunities, and the importance of being respectful of others and treating people the way you would like to be treated.</p>
          <p>With us having the first matariki holiday weekend recently, it has been great to see NZ celebrating a piece of maori culture and hopefully we will embrace it as a nation and it will become part of our collective culture as NZers.</p>
