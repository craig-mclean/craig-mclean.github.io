            <h2>Formulate a learning plan</h2>
              <p>In Sprint 2, we were asked to formulate a learning plan that addresses the following elements:</p>
                <ul>                 
                  <li><a href="#career">Long-term career goal/pathway</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#strengths">Learning strengths and limitations</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#develop">Non-technical/core skills to develop further</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#workload">Commitment to how I will manage my workload</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#help">How and where will I seek help in a timely way</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#facilitation">My expectations from the Facilitation Team</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#schedule">Identify any scheduling issues</a></li>              
                </ul>
              <p>I discuss each of these in more detail below.</p>

                <h3 id="career">Long-term career goal/pathway</h3>
                <p>I am currently working as an accountant, but my role is no longer full-time. Rather than finding additional accounting work, I aim to use DevAcademy as a way to transition from this to a new career as a Web Developer.</p>
                <p>My plan, at the conclusion of this course, is to return to full-time employment, by seeking part-time web-development work (up to 50%).</p>
                <p>Over time, as my web development skills, experience and earning potential all increase (and on the assumption that I am good at it and enjoy it!), I will gradually look to move more away from accounting, towards full-time web development.</p>
                <p> But who knows, there may also be opportunities to combine the skillsets (hello Xero! ;-)</p>
                <p>I expect that this will take some time (e.g. possibly 3-5 years).</p>
                  
                <h3 id="strengths">Learning strengths and limitations</h3>
                <p>During foundations, I have discovered that I learn better by observing (e.g. video examples) and doing (practicing), as opposed to reading long articles or technical guides.</p>
                <p>Obviously there will be times when I need to do both, but I think overall, the style of learning at DevAcademy should suit me well.</p>
                
                <h3 id="develop">Non-technical/core skills to develop further</h3>
                <p>It would be good to work on becoming more assertive and direct with people.</p>
                
                <h3 id="workload">Commitment to how I will manage my workload</h3>
                <p>This question is in two parts:</p>
                  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <h4>How will I manage myself to work productively and safely with others?</h4>
                      <p>I will attempt to honour any commitments I make to team mates and will communicate my progress clearly.</p>
                    <h4>What will I do when things are building up and starting to get to me?</h4>
                    <p>If I am struggling, I will make sure people who may be relying on me know and will seek help accordingly.
                    I might also take some time out to de-stress, by doing something I enjoy (exercise, music, spending time with family/friends), to clear my head.  
                    </p>
                  </div>
                
                <h3 id="help">How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h3>
                <p>Depending on the nature of the issue, I will raise it with the facilitation team, team mates, or family and friends, as appropriate.</p>
                
                <h3 id="facilitation">What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
                <p>I don't expect all members of the faciliation team to be available at all times, but I do expect that they make it clear who is available to help and when.</p>

                <h3 id="schedule">Identify any scheduling issues, when I am committed to other things</h3>
                <p>I have made it clear to family and friends that, during bootcamp, I will need to be fully committed to my studies. However, there will be times when things crop up that I will have to give priority to.</p>
                <p>I will give as much advance notice of these times as possible.</p>
