                With this in miond, we have been asked to revisit our learning plan and update it accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have shown my learning plan for Bootcamp below, while my original plan from Sprint 2 can still be found <a href="#sprint2">here</a>.

              <h2>Learning Plan for Bootcamp</h2>
              <p>
                We will be heading into Bootcamp in a week from now, and this will provide us with a different set of pressures
                and challenges from those in Foundations. 
              </p>

              <h3>WHAT IS YOUR LONG TERM GOAL AND/OR CAREER PATHWAY?</h3>
                <p>
                  I’m hoping that after graduating from the DevAcademy programme, I will be equipped to pick up a web development role within the small 
                  (but growing) tech scene here in Queenstown.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think it would be very helpful for my on-going learning and development, especially in a junior role, to be physically part of a team. 
                  This will make it easier to establish myself and enable me to learn from others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then in time, as I gain more experience, I may be able to widen my options and perhaps look at opportunities in other centres, perhaps working remotely.  
                  It would great to be able to combine my new career with travel at some stage.
                </p>
                <p>  
                  For the next few years though, I envisage continuing my current part-time position as an accountant in Arrowtown, in parallel with web development. In part, this would be to help cushion the drop in income that will come with a career change. Over time though, I would look to shift more and more towards web development.
                </p>
              <h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR BIGGEST STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS WILL BE IN BOOTCAMP?</h3>
                <p>
                  The last few weeks, during Foundations, have reinforced what I thought previously, which is that I learn better by observing 
                  (e.g. video examples) and doing (practicing), rather than by reading articles and technical guides.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I expect it will initially be challenging to work with others and to have to explain my thinking and approach on-the-fly, 
                  when I'm still learning and coming to grips wih the concepts and the syntax, myself.
                  Sometimes it takes me a while to get my head around a problem and I can find it difficult to talk about it meaningfully 
                  until I've had a chance to do that on my own.
                <p>
                  I suspect that in Bootcamp, we won't always have that opportunity! 
                </p>
                <h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR BIGGEST NON-TECHNICAL CHALLENGE AT BOOTCAMP WILL BE?</h3>
                <p>
                  I have struggled at times to stick to the suggested time box times, so I’ll need to be mindful of that as we go into BootCamp, 
                  where there will be a need to move at pace. I will also need to manage my time well, so that I still have some 
                  availability for family and some time off to recharge, get some exercise and think about something else occasionally!
                </p>
              <h3>WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FROM THE BOOTCAMP TEAM?</h3>
                <p>
                  I expect the Bootcamp team will:  
                </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>provide clear direction and be encouraging and supportive </li>
                    <li>be available when they say they are going to be</li>
                    <li>help us become more esilient, by giving us the tools to help ourselves/each other, rather than just providing us with the answers.</li>
                    <li>not only be knowledgeable, but good at imparting their knowledge, in an non-judgemental way.</li>
                    <li>give honest and helpful feedback. </li>
                  </ul>
              <h3>WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF YOURSELF ON BOOTCAMP?</h3>
                <p>
                  In Bootcamp we will be working more with others, so it will be much more important for us to strike the right balance between taking some 
                  time to explore answers to problems that we face, while also making sure we aren’t taking too long and holding things up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I personally never like asking for help unless I’ve tried really hard to find a solution myself. Sometimes during Foundations this has meant 
                  I have probably spent too long on some tasks.  That’s OK when the only person I’m holding up is me and if I still have time to catch up later, 
                  but if I’m part of a team and we have a fixed deadline, then I’ll need to manage this more carefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My commitment is to make sure I meet any obligations I have made to others (team mates, facilitators, etc) and to raise a flag early and seek 
                  extra assistance if it looks like I am at risk of not meeting those commitments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will also have the same expectations of others that I am working with and relying on during any team assignments.
                </p>
  


              <h2 id="sprint2">Sprint 2 - Learning plan</h2>

              <p>
                In Sprint 2, we were asked to formulate a learning plan that addresses the following elements:
              </p>
                <ul>                 
                  <li><a href="#career">Long-term career goal/pathway</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#strengths">Learning strengths and limitations</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#develop">Non-technical/core skills to develop further</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#workload">Commitment to how I will manage my workload</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#help">How and where will I seek help in a timely way</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#facilitation">My expectations from the Facilitation Team</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#schedule">Identify any scheduling issues</a></li>              
                </ul>
              <p>I discuss each of these in more detail below.</p>

                <h3 id="career">Long-term career goal/pathway</h3>
                <p>I am currently working as an accountant, but my role is no longer full-time. Rather than finding additional accounting work, I aim to use DevAcademy as a way to transition from this to a new career as a Web Developer.</p>
                <p>My plan, at the conclusion of this course, is to return to full-time employment, by seeking part-time web-development work (up to 50%).</p>
                <p>Over time, as my web development skills, experience and earning potential all increase (and on the assumption that I am good at it and enjoy it!), I will gradually look to move more away from accounting, towards full-time web development.</p>
                <p> But who knows, there may also be opportunities to combine the skillsets (hello Xero! ;-)</p>
                <p>I expect that this will take some time (e.g. possibly 3-5 years).</p>
                  
                <h3 id="strengths">Learning strengths and limitations</h3>
                <p>During foundations, I have discovered that I learn better by observing (e.g. video examples) and doing (practicing), as opposed to reading long articles or technical guides.</p>
                <p>Obviously there will be times when I need to do both, but I think overall, the style of learning at DevAcademy should suit me well.</p>
                
                <h3 id="develop">Non-technical/core skills to develop further</h3>
                <p>It would be good to work on becoming more assertive and direct with people.</p>
                
                <h3 id="workload">Commitment to how I will manage my workload</h3>
                <p>This question is in two parts:</p>
                  <div style="margin-left:20px;">
                    <h4>How will I manage myself to work productively and safely with others?</h4>
                      <p>I will attempt to honour any commitments I make to team mates and will communicate my progress clearly.</p>
                    <h4>What will I do when things are building up and starting to get to me?</h4>
                    <p>If I am struggling, I will make sure people who may be relying on me know and will seek help accordingly.
                    I might also take some time out to de-stress, by doing something I enjoy (exercise, music, spending time with family/friends), to clear my head.  
                    </p>
                  </div>
                
                <h3 id="help">How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h3>
                <p>Depending on the nature of the issue, I will raise it with the facilitation team, team mates, or family and friends, as appropriate.</p>
                
                <h3 id="facilitation">What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
                <p>I don't expect all members of the faciliation team to be available at all times, but I do expect that they make it clear who is available to help and when.</p>

                <h3 id="schedule">Identify any scheduling issues, when I am committed to other things</h3>
                <p>I have made it clear to family and friends that, during bootcamp, I will need to be fully committed to my studies. However, there will be times when things crop up that I will have to give priority to.</p>
                <p>I will give as much advance notice of these times as possible.</p>
